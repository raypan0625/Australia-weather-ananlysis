# Australia-weather-ananlysis
Australia is a continental island country located in the southern hemisphere. It attracts billions of travelers
each year. This data set contains the daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations
from 2008. There are a total of 1685 observations and 19 columns of variables, including locations of the
weather stations, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind gust speed, humidity, pressure, etc.
We took this data set from https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package. The original
data set contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia, and we
took only the data of the year 2008 from Canberra.
We hope to understand the general weather in Australia, for example the minimum temperature and chance
of rain, so that we know when we should travel to Australia during the year for vacation.
